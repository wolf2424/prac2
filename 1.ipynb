    "Theory\n",
    "What is GC content, and why is it important?\n",
    "GC content represents the percentage of guanine and cytosine bases in a DNA sequence. It’s important because GC-rich regions tend to be more stable due to the triple hydrogen bonds between G and C, compared to the double bonds in AT pairs. GC content can impact the DNA's melting temperature and the stability of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this code identify coding regions in the DNA sequence?\n",
    "he code identifies coding regions by locating the start codon (\"ATG\") and then searching for the nearest stop codon (\"TAA,\" \"TAG,\" or \"TGA\") downstream. When a start-stop pair is found, it’s considered a coding region, and the code stores the start and end indices of that region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we use the startswith method to find motifs?\n",
    "The startswith method is used because it efficiently checks if the substring starting at a specific position matches the motif. This is faster and more concise than manually comparing each substring to the motif.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does the code do if no coding regions are found?\n",
    "f no coding regions are found, the code outputs \"No coding regions found.\" This avoids errors and provides feedback if there are no matches for the start or stop codons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we multiply the GC content calculation by 100?\n",
    "Multiplying by 100 converts the GC content from a fraction to a percentage, making it easier to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can this code handle lowercase DNA sequences?\n",
    "No, it only works with uppercase sequences because it specifically counts \"G\" and \"C\" and checks for uppercase motifs like \"CGT.\" To handle lowercase, we could use dna_sequence.upper() at the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "How could you modify the code to find a different motif in the sequence?\n",
    "To search for a different motif, simply change the motif variable to the desired sequence. The rest of the code will automatically search for that motif in the sequence."
