    "What is an inverted index, and why is it useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: An inverted index is a data structure that maps terms to their occurrences in documents. It allows efficient retrieval of documents containing specific terms, making it ideal for search engines and information retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this code handle case sensitivity and stopwords?\n",
    "Answer: The code converts all text to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive matching and removes a set of predefined stopwords to focus on meaningful terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the purpose of using defaultdict in constructing the inverted index.\n",
    "Answer: defaultdict with list as the default type automatically initializes a list for each new word, simplifying the addition of document IDs to the inverted index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is the set() used in the retrieve_documents function?\n",
    "Answer: set() is used to avoid duplicate document IDs in the results when multiple terms from the query are found in the same document.\n",
    "\n",
    "How could you enhance this inverted index for more advanced search capabilities?\n",
    "Answer: To enhance it, we could add support for phrase queries, term frequency weighting, stemming or lemmatization for better word normalization, or Boolean operators to refine searches further."
