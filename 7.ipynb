    "What is a Bayesian Network?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: A Bayesian Network is a probabilistic graphical model representing a set of variables and their conditional dependencies using a directed acyclic graph (DAG). It is commonly used for modeling uncertain knowledge and performing inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we use Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) in this code?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: MLE is used to estimate the parameters of the CPDs in the Bayesian Network. It finds the parameters that maximize the likelihood of the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the role of Variable Elimination in Bayesian Networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Variable Elimination is an inference algorithm used to compute the probabilities of certain variables given evidence. It simplifies the network by systematically eliminating variables not required for the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we need to define dependencies manually in a Bayesian Network?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Dependencies reflect the assumed causal relationships in the model. Defining these manually helps the network accurately represent the real-world relationships among variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can this model predict heart disease for new patients?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Yes, by entering the new patient's data as evidence, the model can infer the probability of heart disease based on learned dependencies. However, the accuracy depends on the quality and coverage of the training data."
